# Lambda JWT Router
Simple HTTP router for working with Json Web Tokens (JWTs) on AWS Lambda through APIGateway proxy requests.
Supports local HTTP routing through net/http for local testing, debugging, and development.
Supports setting an HMAC secret for signing and verifying JWTs.
Supports automatically replying to OPTIONS requests so calls from browsers succeed.
